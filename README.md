Quantified geek self.

I work at home, do lots of stuff online, and I think it might be cool to track what I do beyond just what's pushed to Github and shows up in those little green squares.

Suppose I keep track of IRC and activity in a code editor. Then I could check if those kinds of interruptions are really having an impact on my day. It's 'know thyself', but in a nerdy little package.

concept: lifestream including public APIs (bugzilla, github, gists, lastfm) and weird other local/personal data (calendar, code editor, IRC client, maybe even browser tabs?).

I'll want to self-host the aggregated data, seems potentially quite creepy to expose it publicly.

Once there's data, seems like I could do lots of interesting things with it. Like, say, "ping me after 5 min on IRC, remind me to get back to work." Or, "auto-disable alerts when I'm in deep flow coding mode."

Aside from using the data to optimize productivity or other industrial production flavored stuff, it might be nice to just visualize the life stream of events in a pretty way.
